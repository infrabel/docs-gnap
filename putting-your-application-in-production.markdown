## Building your application

GNaP.Web.Themes comes with tooling to build your application so that it's ready for production.

Execute the following command in a command prompt that is opened at the root of your application:

```
grunt build
```

After this task has completed you should see a new folder named `dist`.

<nav>
  <ul class="pager">
    <li class="next"><a href="{{ "troubleshooting-your-application" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Troubleshooting your application <span aria-hidden="true">&rarr;</span></a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
